# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to improve query responses by leveraging external document contexts. It uses semantic embeddings and a vector database to efficiently retrieve contextually relevant information for generating answers.

## Features
- **Semantic Query Processing**: Processes queries using embeddings to retrieve the most relevant document sections.
- **Integration with Large Language Models**: Utilizes OpenAI's models to generate answers based on the retrieved context.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive notebook that demonstrates end-to-end functionality from setup to query response.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Access to a GPU (preferably a T4 for optimal performance)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/djenning90/retrieval-augmented-generation.git
